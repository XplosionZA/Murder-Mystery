        <p>A lot of the enjoyment to be gained from this Murder Mystery comes from dressing up and getting into the part of your character.

            You are a former Army Major and well-known explorer; indeed, you recently achieved notoriety by climbing Everest single handedly, without a guide, ropes, oxygen or map…you reached the summit dressed only in your finest tweeds and topped off with a deer-stalker. A staggering achievement! You were Lord Shippe’s oldest friend and a witness to the tragic accident.

            Dress with the immaculate precision typical of a former Army Major. We suggest the following dress code:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Three-piece Tweed suit;<br>
            Deer stalker or flat cap;<br>
            Bow tie;<br>
            Big hairy moustache.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p>
            You should speak with a military voice, barking out instructions and evidence.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Feel free to use other styles or accessories as you see fit.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is no need to purchase new clothing for you outfit! <br>
            You can do some thrifting or even make do with what you have in you wardrobe.

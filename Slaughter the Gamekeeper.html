            You originally met Lord Shippe in the Army where you served as his batman. You have a gruff and surly manner but are also in possession of a sense of humour, coarse though it is. You tend to drink a tad too much; however, you are widely admired for your skills as a hunter. You were on hand when tragedy struck at Shippe Manor.

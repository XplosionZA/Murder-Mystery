            A lot of the enjoyment to be gained from this Murder Mystery comes from dressing up and getting into the part of your character.

            You are a typical 1930s society lady and speak with a plummy, upper class accent. You are an avid party-goer and a bit of a social-climber. You love to name-drop and have an ear for any juicy society gossip. You and Lord Shippe have tried to have children but, unfortunately, you have been unable to pride His Lordship with an heir.

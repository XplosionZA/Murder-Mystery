            You are the spiritual house guest of Lord & Lady Shippe. A faith-healer and fortune-teller you have cultivated many influential friends who make use of your powers. You tour the country offering yours services to the rich and famous who find your charms irresistible. You claim to have Gypsy roots and have a reputation for being somewhat eccentric.

            Whilst you could dress as a typical Gypsy fortune-teller you do very well out of rich friends who are in awe of your ‘gift’. You dress as befits the circle you mix with. We suggest the following dress code:

            1930s style dress;<br>
            Pearl necklace;<br>
            Brightly painted nails;<br>
            Perfectly applied make-up bordering on theatrical.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>

            You should talk in a slow, precise way as if listening to the spirit world.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Feel free to use other styles or accessories as you see fit.

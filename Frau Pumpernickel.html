        <p>You are the cook at the country home of the Gottalotta-Dosh family, headed by Lord Shippe. You took up the post six months ago. You are stern, matronly and somewhat imposing and frequently frighten people with your strong Bavarian accent. Whilst your cooking leaves a lot to be desired it was not the cause of Lord Shippeâ€™s death! We suggest the following dress code:

    <div>
        <p>
        Polka dot dress and apron;<br>
        Round metal glasses;<br>
        Little or no make-up;<br>
        Ruddy cheeks.<br>
    </p>

            The Frau is rather plump and would have her hair scraped up into cook's hat.
